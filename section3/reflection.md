## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  > One point in the article that resonated with me was that it can be easy to feel that time has been wasted when a bug takes a lot of time to troubleshoot & resolve. However, this is part of the learning process. Learning is taking place during that struggle, so it's not a waste of time.

  > Another point that resonated with me, that also relates to the previous point, is to learn when to ask for help. There is value in struggling on your own if you're making progress on the problem. However, once progress ceases, it's time to ask for help.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  > Currently, I demonstrate a growth mindset by diligently practicing to improve at my pursuits. I'm very good at holding myself accountable, setting goals, & being consistent. I also demonstrate a growth mindset by never giving up after experiencing set-backs.

  > I can better adopt a growth mindset by understanding that learning is an endless journey, not a destination. There's always more to learn. I will also work on being open to feedback & understanding that putting my work out there will make me a better developer. I'll strive to review feedback objectively & be grateful for suggestions/critiques that will improve my work.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

  > A Hash is a data container that holds key-value pairs. It differs from an Array in that the values in an Array are integer-indexed (0, 1, 2, etc), whereas a Hash is indexed by defined keys, which don't have to be integers.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  ```ruby
  pet_store = {fish_tanks: 9, dog_bowls: 24, litter_boxes: 16}
  ```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

  ```ruby
  states["IA"]
  ```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

  ```ruby
  states.keys
  states.values
  ```

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

  > A hash can be used to store bank account info. A hash is better than an array for this because it allows the programmer to define the keys that will be used to access the values, which helps to identify & contextualize the values associated with those keys. The keys could include 'account number', 'account owner', 'available balance', etc.  

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  > What would be a use-case for nested hashes irl?
