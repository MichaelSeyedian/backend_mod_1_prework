## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

> I found the SuperLearner article to be very insightful. I really enjoy reading,
so I already do a lot of that. I also do a good job of taking care of my brain &
keeping a growth mindset. I'd like to get better at viewing learning as a process, rather than a destination. I could probably afford to take more small breaks as well. I'd add that SuperLearners are probably consistent & disciplined.
