## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

> I found the SuperLearner article to be very insightful. The article mentioned that SuperLearners are avid readers. I really enjoy reading, so I already do a lot of that. I also do a good job of taking care of my brain & keeping a growth mindset. I'd like to get better at viewing learning as a process, rather than a destination. I could probably afford to take more small breaks as well. I'm no expert on SuperLearners, but I'd imagine they're also consistent & disciplined.  

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

  ```ruby
  p "Hello World!"
  ```

2. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

  ```ruby
  #
  ```

3. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  > A float has a decimal point, whereas an integer does not.

4. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

  ```ruby
  animal = "zebra"
  ```

5. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

  ```ruby
  p animal
  ```

6. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  > Interpolation means injecting ruby code into a string.

  ```ruby
  p "I rode the #{animal} on the merry-go-round."
  ```

7. What method is used to get input from a user?

  ```ruby
  gets.chomp
  ```

8. Name and describe two common string methods:

  `.length` - returns the number of characters (including spaces) in a string.
  <br />
  `.split` - converts a string into an Array of strings where each word is a value in the Array.
